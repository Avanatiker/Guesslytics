## Development üë®‚Äçüíª

This project is built with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for type safety
- [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) for bundling and minification
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for data visualization

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avanatiker/Guesslytics && cd Guesslytics && yarn && yarn dev
```

### Development Commands

- `yarn dev` - Start the development server with auto-reload
- `yarn build` - Build the production script
- `yarn lint` - Run the linter

### Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `src/lib/` - Utility modules
  - `api.ts` - API-related functions
  - `constants.ts` - Constants and configuration
  - `ui.ts` - UI-related functions
  - `utils.ts` - Helper functions
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `index.ts` - Main type definitions
  - `global.d.ts` - Global ambient declarations

## Migration Notes

This project was migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript. The migration involved:

1. Creating proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
2. Organizing the code into modules for better maintainability
3. Adding type annotations to all functions and variables
4. Creating ambient declarations for Tampermonkey API and Chart.js
5. Setting up the build process to generate the Tampermonkey script

## Future Improvements

- Clean up unused imports and variables flagged by the linter
- Add unit tests for critical functionality
- Improve error handling for API requests
- Add more detailed documentation for each module
- Consider using a state management pattern for better data flow
- Add localization support for multiple languages
